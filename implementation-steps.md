     - Students: Enrollment/Roll Number + Password
     - Recruiters: Email + Password
     - Admins: Email + Password

2. **Registration Page**

3. **Authentication Guard**
   - Renamed `src/components/auth/Login.jsx` to `src/components/auth/AuthGuard.jsx`
   - Updated component name from `Login` to `AuthGuard`
   - Used to protect routes that require authentication

4. **Admin Portal**

   - Updated both desktop and mobile menus

7. **Home.jsx**
   - Added a section for faculty and staff that links to the admin portal

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User selects their role (student, recruiter, or admin)
   - User fills out role-specific registration form
   - Form validation ensures all required fields are completed correctly
   - On successful registration, user is redirected to the login page

2. **Login**
   - User selects their role (student, recruiter, or admin)
   - Student enters enrollment number and password
   - Recruiter/Admin enters email and password
   - On successful login:
     - User data is stored in state and localStorage
     - User is redirected to the appropriate portal based on their role

3. **Authentication Guard**
   - Protects routes that require authentication
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
   - Used to protect the admin portal and future dashboard routes

4. **Logout**
   - Removes user data from state and localStorage
   - Updates UI to show login/register buttons

## Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace simulated authentication with actual API calls
   - Implement JWT or session-based authentication
   - Add proper error handling for API responses

2. **User Dashboards**
   - Create role-specific dashboards for students, recruiters, and admins
   - Implement features like profile management, application tracking, etc.

3. **Email Verification**
   - Add email verification step during registration
   - Implement password reset functionality

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Add two-factor authentication option
