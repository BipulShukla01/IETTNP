# Logo Replacement Instructions

To use your own logo image:

1. Add your logo image file to this directory (the `public` folder)
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the src path in `src/assets/logo.jsx` if using a different filename)
3. Make sure your logo has a transparent background for best results
4. A square aspect ratio is recommended (e.g., 200x200 pixels)
5. For the favicon, you can either:
   - Replace `favicon.svg` with your own SVG favicon
   - Add a `favicon.ico` file and update the link in `index.html`

## Recommended Logo Specifications

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: At least 200x200 pixels (larger is better for high-resolution displays)
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
- Background: Transparent

## Logo Placement

The logo appears in these locations:
- Navbar (top left)
- Footer (about section)
- Hero section (homepage)
- Browser tab (favicon)

## Troubleshooting

If your logo doesn't appear:
1. Check that the file is in the correct location
2. Verify the filename matches what's in the code
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Make sure the image file isn't corrupted
